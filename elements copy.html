									<p>In this project we analyze employment data to find any pay inequalities due to inappropriate variables such as ethinicity or gender. The main statistal tool we use for this analysis is a log-linear regression model. To view the full R code, please follow the link below: <li><a href="https://github.com/whalendevin/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/monthly%20recession%20indicators.R" class="button"><strong>Full R Code</strong></a></li></p>

									<h2>The Data</h2>
									<p>The data used for the model consists of 21 variables and 526 observations. Typically with pay data the dependent variable, in this case "wage", has a skewed distribution and it is typically skewed to the right. This can result in biased results in regression. To correct for this issue we log-transform the dependent variable to normalize the distribution. Below are sample pictures of the data.</p>
									<span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/pay equity data 1.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/pay equity data 1.png" alt="" /></span> <p><strong>...........</strong></p> <p><span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/pay equity data 2.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/Pay Equity Header.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>First, we check the distribution of the wage variable to see if it is normal or skewed. If it is skewed, the mean will be biased. This is a major problem since Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression uses the mean as a basis for regression. Thus, a skewed distribution will render the regression results biased and incorrect conclusions about the data will be made. <span class="image"></span></p><img style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/wage distribution" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
									<p>We can see that the distribution for wage is skewed to the right. Therefore, we will log-transform the data and see if it allows for a more normal distribution.</p><span class="image"></span></p><img style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/log wage distribution" class="img-responsive" alt="" />
								    <p>Indeed the log-transformed wage distribution takes on a more normal distribution. It is important to note that if a normal distribution cannot be achieved, then quantile regression is another tool in which we can analyze pay data and it does not require a normal distribution. Our next step is to look at the correlations between variables - particularly the correlations the other variables have with the variable wage. Below are the correlation plots and the R code.</p>

									  <h2>Modeling and Regression</h2>
									  <p>Using scatter plots we can see if some of our variables need to be higher order polynomials for a better fit to the model. Tenure and experience seem to be variables that should be quadradics instead of straight lines. Below are the comparisons. Later when we estimate the regression model we will see if the R-squared gives us a better fit with these quadradics added into the model.</p>
									  <p>We start by plotting the linear model of log-wage and experience.</p>
									  <span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/wage experience linear plot" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/wage experience linear plot" alt="" /></span>
									  <p></p>
									  <p>Next we plot the nonlinear model of log-wage and experience.</p>
									  <span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/wage experience nonlinear plot" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/wage experience nonlinear plot" alt="" /></span>
									  <p>We can see that the variable experience should at least be a quadradic in the model. We repeat this with the variable tenure as well.</p>
									  <span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/wage tenure linear plot " style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/wage tenure linear plot" alt="" /></span>
									  <span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/wage tenure nonlinear plot" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/wage tenure nonlinear plot" alt="" /></span>
									  <p>Again, we see a nonlinear relationship between wage and tenure but perhaps to a lesser degree than wage and experience.</p>
									  <hr class="major" />
									  <h2>Regression</h2>
									  <p></p>
									  <p>First we estimate a model with all relevent variables to observe statistical significance. </p>
									  <span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/equity regression all variables.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/equity regression all variables.png" alt="" /></span>
									  <p>We can see that none of the regional variables are statistically significant. Other variables such as experience also show up as not statistically significant which does not make sense. Next we estimate the model with experience and tenure as quadradics.</p>
									  <span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/equity regression quadradics.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/equity regression quadradics.png" alt="" /></span>
									  <p>After modeling the quadradics, experience is now statistically significant at the 99% confidence level. The higher order tenure however is only significant at the 90% confidence level. This makes sense considering the earlier scatter plots. Therefore, we will use the adjusted R-squared to see which order of tenure is a better fit for the model.</p>
									  <span class="w-25 h-auto"><img src="images/equity regression onequad.png" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'src="images/equity regression onequad.png" alt="" /></span>
									  <p>The Adjusted R-squares are almost identical to each other with only a difference of 0.0018. This tells us that making tenure a quadradic does not do much for the model. Therefore, we will keep it in the model as a linear variable.</p>
									  <hr class="major" />
									  <h2>Interpretation and Conclusions</h2>
									  <p>Recall that the purpose of this analysis was to find innapropriate causes for unequitable pay. The two variables that would be innapropriate causes for unequitable pay in this model are gender and race. Let us first consider the variable gender, labeled as female in the model, which is a binary (or dummy) variable which is equal to 1 if female. 
										This variable is statistically significant at the 99% confidence level and the coefficient is -0.268. Since we log-transformed the wage variable, to interpret this coefficient we take the exponential of the coefficient and then subtract by one. This gives us -0.23 or -23%. Thus, with all other variables held constant, we can conclude that if you are female you will make 23% less than if you were a male. This is an inappropriate cause of a pay gap.</p>
									  <p>Lastly, we interpret the non-white variable to see if race is a cause of unequitable pay. The first thing to note is that the non-white variable is not statistically significant in the model. This means that we cannot conclude a causal relationship between race and pay. However, we still observe the coefficient. The non-white variable is a binary variable which equals 1 if non-white. 
										Using the same methods for interpretation that we used for gender, the coefficient for non-white is 0.001 or 0.1%. Since this is such a small number, we can conclude that the variable non-white in this model is both statistically and practically insignificant. By practical significance we mean that the size of the coefficient is too small to make a realistic difference. 
									  </p>
									  <p>In conclusion, we find that there is a pay gap of 23% due to gender which is an inapropriate cause of unequitable pay. However, race is neither statistically nor practically significant in this model and therefore is not a cause of unequitable pay.</p>
